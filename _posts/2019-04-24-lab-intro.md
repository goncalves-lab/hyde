  Hi there! Welcome to our lab webpage.
</p>

We are a new group at [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/somatische-evolution-frueherkennung/index.php), since February 2018. Our group aims to understand the processes of somatic and regulatory genome evolution during ageing and carcinogenesis. We combine experimental approaches with bioinformatic analyses and statistical modelling (20% experimental, 80% computational), with a long-term view of improving the early detection of cancer.
